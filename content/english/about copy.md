Hello,

My name is Jose, I have a degree in Economics from Carlos III and I am interested in the intersection between economics and technology. In my final degree project I studied how to use neural networks in the prediction of time series and along the way I learned Python and R.

I started working in companies in the technology sector such as [EventBank] (https://www.glueup.com/) and [Alto Analytics] (https://www.alto-analytics.com/en_US). And I spent almost 2 years in a big data startup for the vacation rental sector, [Transparent] (https://seetransparent.com/en/).

I am now studying at Tilburg University for a master's degree in Economics with a specialization in Data Science while also working as a mentor in the [Springboard] Data Analytics bootcamp (https://www.springboard.com/).

This page is open to tell you what I am discovering on my own.

Thanks for reading me,

Jose
