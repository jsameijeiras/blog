_Disclaimer: I work as a mentor for Springboard an I give my students this list to work a bit in their personal projects. If you are one of my mentees just be aware this is my personal work and Springboard has not participation on this part. It is just for your inspiration._

This a curated list of topics that I personally find interesting. It is not meant to be compulsory to work a project of this list. However, I see the next benefits on this list:

- **You work in a project that is actually real:** Some of the proposals made here are elaborated from case studies of my previous works or my studies.

- **My help is going to be more meaningful:** Even though I can help in any idea that you have, given that this is actually my job, grasping a problem and figuring out how to solve it with data, the problems posted here are either problem I solved or I am willing to solve. More likely the latter. If it is the case that I already solve it, you can help me see new ways.

Furthermore, I want you to be able to make a great signal to the market about your abilities. 
Signalling that you know how to do something is complex, indeed a topic with a lot of research. However, this information gap can be overcome with:
- certifications, thatâ€™s what you are doing with Springboard.
- creating a portfolio of previous work, that is what I want to build with you.

You can pick up these topics either for the Capstone 1 or the Capstone 2. However, I recommend you to choose a topic out of this list for Capstone 1 and use one of this list for Capstone 2.

- What are the main factors affecting the Airbnb listings price? Can it actually be predicted?
    - Inside Airbnb is a good starting point.
- Can we create an index similar to the big mac index with data of delivery markets (Just Eat, Deliveroo, etc)? Can we use other standard goods or a combination of them? 
    - This requires some scraping techniques if you cannot find datasets yourself.
- Creating a prediction model with data of the Walmart sales (M5 Competiton)?
    - [M5 Competition website.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy)
- How does COVID - 19 affected your area? 
    - Can we create a tool to visualize the current status of hospitals and vaccination? 
    - Can we explain the reasons why your area behaved better/worse than the rest?
    - Data here depends on your region.
- Can we create a tool to analyse the topics more important among the politics of a certain area with NLP?
    - Data here depends on your region.
- How does an economic incentive improve your answers to a survey?
    - I can provide you with data if you do not find a dataset of other experiments.
- Does minimum wages affect unemployment? 
- Does street prostitution regulation affect crime reduction?
    - [Starting point](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/114656/version/V1/view)
- Is there racial discrimination in the sharing economy?
    - [Good data](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113691/version/V1/view)
- Can we determine the potential voters of a political party given the results of the previous elections?

You might not find data to answer all these questions but I will help you with it. Either scraping it myself or finding you alternative sources. However, try to look for alternative sources, since most of the ones I provide in the list might get old.
