+++

The summary is: Signal does not store your data, WhatsApp does. In my opinion, it translates into the following benefits:

### Privacy by default.  

Both Signal and Whatsapp encrypt the data of your conversations. However, while Signal does not share metadata with third parties, Facebook (and therefore Whatsapp) exploits that metadata to generate profit. I do not see anything immoral in doing this, but I prefer to keep my data private, such as my contact list, from where I message, to whom I message, how much I do it and at what time.

### Informal conversations are ephemeral again. 

With Signal I decide how long each of my messages lasts in your phone. This entails maximum freedom of expression in informal conversations. When talking about privacy, the question is not only whether Facebook has your data or not. It is, for example, whether your ex-partner has the right to have all the conversations you have shared in the past. It is also whether your co-worker should keep the conversation where you complain about your boss. It is questionable if every word should be kept forever. In my opinion, instant messaging networks are places where you chat as you would do on the street. The technology we currently use does not emulate that reality. Signal allows me to speak without being afraid that my words will be used against me, as I would do in the street.

### Open Source.

I am aware that many feel indifferent about this, but it is beneficial that the structure of a project is public. This gives the possibility to be audited by anyone [^1]. Even if not everyone might understand everything, the option of public auditing exists. 

### There is data that no government should be able to access.

When we generate data, it is stored on servers and it immediately becomes susceptible to being seized by the government. I am not saying this happens frequently, but there are many attempts to allow backdoors for an end to end encryption[^ 2] [^ 3] and there are reasons to be sceptical. By using WhatsApp you make the decision to take that risk. You decide whether to leave your data to WhatsApp and thus to who governs today or will do it in 20 years from now. At least with my conversations, I have decided not to take this risk. Signal has shown that it will not share your data even if the authorities ask for it, because it simply does not save it. [^ 4]

### We don't want to create companies that are too big to fail.

Banking is not the only sector where we want to avoid giants that can drag us down with their mistakes. Right now if the big three server providers (Google, Microsoft and Amazon) disappeared from the market, the internet would collapse. As consumers, our decisions are usually restricted to the supply, but there are situations like this one when the decision is easy and free. By using Signal I stop using a Facebook service and therefore I encourage competition in the market as well as supporting the development of another organization.

Therefore, from today on I will gradually leave WhatsApp. For this reason, I ask you to please do the same so that I won't be just talking to myself. But don't worry, it's not an act of arrogance. If you are not on Signal I will find a way to communicate with you when necessary.

Thanks for reading and if you also want to leave WhatsApp, you can forward this message!
