The summary is Signal doesn't store your data, WhatsApp does. This in my opinion translates into the following benefits:

### The default privacy.

 The data of your conversations is encrypted, as in WhatsApp, but also no metadata is shared with third parties. On the contrary, the purpose of Facebook (owner of WhatsApp) as a private company is to generate profit and for this they exploit your data. I do not see anything immoral in doing it but my contact list, from where I message, to whom I message, how much I do it and at what time I prefer to keep it private. In addition to it, Signal depends on a non-profit foundation, whose purpose is to provide the best private communication service.

### Informal conversations must once again be ephemeral.

That means we must have the maximum freedom of expression in our close circles. The question is no longer just whether Facebook has your data or not, it is whether, for example, your ex-partner has the right to have all the conversations you have shared in the past. If your coworker can save that conversation where you talk about the bad day you have had and where you may not have spoken so well about your boss. Every word, there, kept forever. In my opinion, instant messaging networks are places where you chat, as you do on the street, but the technology we currently use does not emulate that reality, but one where all the words you write can be used against you. Signal allows me to protect myself without having to trust the other party by automatically deleting the messages in the period of time that I indicate.

### Open Source.

 That gives the possibility that it can be audited by any of us[^1]. Some of us understand a part, others all and some others none. But the public audit option is there. Among big tech, we are still struggling to understand what they store, what they don't and how they do it.

### There is data that no government should be able to access.

When we generate data and it is stored on servers, it immediately becomes susceptible to being required by the government. I'm not saying this happens on a continuous basis, just that the threat exists. You make the decision to take that risk. You decide whether to leave your data to WhatsApp and then to whoever governs today or in 20 years. I have decided not to. Signal has shown that it cannot share your data even if the authorities ask for it because it just doesn't save it, it is saved on your devices. [^2]

### We do not want to create companies too big to fail.

The banking sector is not the only sector where we want to avoid giants that drag us down with their mistakes. At this time, if the big three disappeared from the market, the entire internet would collapse. As consumers we cannot do as much as we would like but there are times like this when the decision is easy and free. By using Signal I stop using a Facebook service and therefore I encourage competition in the market as well as giving another company the possibility to develop.

Therefore, as of February 1st, I have decided not to continue using WhatsApp and switch to Signal. For this reason, I ask you to please do the same so that I won't be just talking to myself. But don't worry, it's not an act of arrogance. If you are not on Signal I will find a way to communicate with you and you with me when necessary. What I will not do is continue on WhatsApp because I do not accept its conditions.
